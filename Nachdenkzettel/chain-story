Yesterday, when I was riding home on the train, something weird happened.
Suddenly, the train stopped abrupt and the lights went out. I felt a cold shiver running down my back.
I saw shadows doing scary noises while flying through the compartments. My heart stopped beating for a second.
Then the light turned on again - silence. I can't move. I'm too scared. There isn't silence no more, I can hear some footsteps right behind me.
