## How to track your habits
### Add a new habit
In order to add a new habit you have to click on the button "Add a new habit" and fill in the form. In the form you can decide on which days you plan to do the habit. Do that by ticking the corresponding checkboxes. After that, the new habit will be shown in the table and you can start to track it.
### Remove a habit
In order to remove a habit you have to click on the button "Remove a habit". After that a new icon will be shown in the table. Click on that icon to remove the habit.
### Jump back to previous weeks
In order to jump back and forth to previous weeks, you can use the two buttons with the arrows above the table. By doing this you can see your progress in the past. Seeing the progress you made is motivating and it might help you to sustain your habits, even when you don't feel like doing so - just because you don't want to "lose your progress".
## How to use the journal
The journal is a simple way to become conscious about what you actually do with your days and stores daily insights. It can store insights, thoughts and basically everything you want it to store. However, it's designed to be a little bit like a twitter tweet - short and expressive. That's why we have limited the length of the text to 200 characters. The entries are also limited in size, which means you can't spam it with infinite empty rows.
### Add a new entry
In order to add a new entry, you need to enter some text into the text area and afterwards click on the "Add entry" button. All entries are ordered by date, so the newest entry will be on top.
## How to change the displayed name
In order to change the displayed name, you can navigate to the settings menu and enter your name there. After that you can hit the "Save changes" button and return to the main page.
